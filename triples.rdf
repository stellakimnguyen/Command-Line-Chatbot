    <ex:cDescription>In this course, stories are read from the entire scope of Jewish history ? from the Bible to modern Jewish film and fiction. Each of these stories will reveal something about the cultures from which they emerged ? their fantasies about themselves and about others; about humans, not-so-humans, and God; about life and death and everything in between. Taken together, these stories tell the story of Judaism, in all its inexhaustible variety and colour.

A key component of the course is studying the emerging field of Indigenous methodologies. Students encounter some of the many expressions of Indigenous spirituality, as it is concretely embedded in all aspects of existence (physical, emotional) and in all our relations, that is, to the land, to human and non-human animals, and to the spirit-imbued world surrounding us. Consideration is also given to the relationship between Indigenous and non-Indigenous spiritualites and methodologies.</ex:cDescription>

    <ex:cDescription>The discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls changed our understanding of early Judaism and shed new light on Christian origins. The Scrolls preserve the oldest copies of the books that would come to be included in the Hebrew Bible, plus hundreds of other Jewish writings of the Hellenistic and early Roman eras: apocalypses, biblical interpretation and apocryphal stories, community rules, hymns and poems, legal and liturgical texts, wisdom literature, and much more. This course provides students with a basic introduction to the Dead Sea Scrolls - the texts, the community, and their ideas - examined in the larger context of early
Judaism.

    <ex:cDescription>An introduction to the use of a high-level mathematical programming language (MAPLE or MATHEMATICA) as a practical aid in doing mathematics. Most classes are given in an interactive way in the computer laboratory. The emphasis is on applications, not on general programming techniques or abstract structures. The aim is to arrive at a sufficient working familiarity with the computer algebra language to permit its regular use in subsequent studies and applications. The commands and online resources are introduced through a review of arithmetic, complex numbers, algebra, Euclidean geometry, trigonometry, coordinate systems and graphing, elementary functions and transformations, series, derivatives, integrals, vectors and matrices. There may be additional topics from domains such as number theory, differential equations, integral transforms, probability and statistics.

Corporations face challenges in the areas of international capital budgeting, determining their cost of capital and their capital structure, assessment of political risk, international working capital management, financing international trade and international corporate governance. This course discusses how these decisions become more complex in an international environment due to changing exchange rates and multiplicity of economic and political environments. The course also addresses the difficulties of choosing appropriate pricing models in an international context.
 Prerequisite: FINA 470.

    <ex:cDescription>This course examines the history, thought, and practices of Yoga in their religious and cultural contexts. In the modern West, Yoga has become popular as a secular form of exercise. However, as this course shows, the diverse Yoga traditions of India have also involved sophisticated analyses of the mind and systems of meditation. Intrinsic to no single religion, Yoga has had roles in most South Asian traditions, including Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, and Sufism or Islamic mysticism. The course surveys this rich history, and the various forms of meditative and physical discipline Yoga has entailed.

    <ex:cDescription>This is a course in applied microeconomic theory. Various observations on the state of professional sports are explained using economic theory. Evidence of the statistical relevance of such explanations is also investigated. Issues addressed include the magnitude of the earnings of professional sports stars; the impact of free agency on competitive balance in sports leagues; the value of professional sports teams to cities, and whether such valuation justifies public subsidization of franchises or arenas.

    <ex:cDescription>This course explores how religion may be seen to engender or exacerbate violence, as well as the ways that religion may critique, prevent or even offer alternatives to violence. Sacred writings, theologies, rituals and communal actions of particular communities are studied, as well as notions of the self, the group, others, outsiders and enemies. In particular, the life-work and writings of such key figures as Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King are studied in order to provide some religious perspectives on the relationship between non-violence and the resistance to injustice.

    <ex:cDescription>This course focuses on the design and analysis of market mechanisms, which are concerned with how to construct rules for allocating resources and how to structure successful marketplaces. It draws on tools of game theory to identify why certain market rules or institutions succeed and why others fail. Topics may include matching markets, auctions, contracts, economic platforms and network effects.
The main objectives of this course are to introduce students to some of the fundamental concepts and ideas in the theory of market design and to connect this theory to real-life markets and to practical aspects of market design policy.

    <ex:cDescription>This course traces a colourful history from the mid-19th century to the present, exploring, amongst other works, the melodramas of Dionysius Boucicault; the pithy plays of Oscar Wilde; the arguably propagandistic work of WB Yeats and Augusta Gregory; the existentialism of Samuel Beckett; the Hiberno-Greek tragedies of Marina Carr; and the Tarantino inspired comedies of Martin McDonagh. Illuminating the politics ? national, postcolonial, gendered and global ? present in Irish theatre, this course shows that when theatre holds a mirror up to the Irish nation, a wider world is reflected back.

This course carries out a comparative study of the rhetorical strategies of literary and extra-literary representation in Golden Age Spain, and their role in the creation of an early modern subject of mass visual culture. Through close textual analysis and critical discussions of representative works by Spanish poets and playwrights such as Garcilaso, Lope, G?ngora, Quevedo, Tirso, and Calder?n, students examine a number of literary and theoretical topics.

(1968 to 1998): the Catholic civil rights movement; the period of armed conflict between the IRA, loyalist paramilitaries, and security forces; and the recent peace process, as well as post-conflict issues including power-sharing, peace and reconciliation, and constitutional change. Attention is also given to cultural expressions of the Troubles and its legacies.

    <ex:cDescription>Under pressure for over 200 years from the expanding use of English, Irish is still considered by many a crucial underpinning of Irish national identity. This course assumes elementary knowledge of the Irish language as a platform for students to access cultural forms (memoirs, poetry, short stories, sean-n?s songs, films) and media such as radio, newspapers, television, and podcasts. In particular, the course examines how language is intimately tied to place and landscape (dinnsheanchas: the Irish lore of place names) and how it both actively and subliminally remains a potent force in Irish cultural life.

    <ex:cDescription>This course explores the political, military, social, and cultural dimensions of the turbulent period in Irish history that dissolved over a century of Anglo-Irish Union and established two new states. The course necessarily focuses on Sinn F?in and the Irish Republican Armys efforts to achieve independence from Britain, but considerable attention is also given to Ulster Unionist resistance to separatism. Additionally, other forces and dynamics that shaped this seminal period are explored, such as sectarian violence in Northern Ireland; conflict between rival nationalist factions in the south; labour and socialist agitations; agrarian discontents; and the womens suffrage and feminist movements.

In this course, students are introduced to some representative approaches to ethical thought and action. General questions about the nature of ethical reasoning are also considered. For example: Are there objective ethical truths or are ethical judgments merely relative to social norms- An effort is made to incorporate those ethical issues which are of specific importance to contemporary society."

    <ex:cDescription>This course is associated with, and normally represents, a prerequisite for Integrative Internship II. Integrative Internship I is designed to allow students to build on their acquired knowledge,skills, values and attitudes through interaction with a chosen education environment. The first Internship requires students to select, contact and establish a working relation with an organization which offers educational activities to adults in their community. A supervised Special Project for an adult education provider is initiated. At this stage, the emphasis is on observation and information gathering, in preparation for taking on a more active role in Integrative Internship II.</ex:cDescription>

    <ex:cDescription>From 17th-century fishermen and traders arriving in Newfoundland to displaced victims of the Famine in the 19th century, to contemporary immigrants from Ireland, the Irish have had a presence in all parts of Canada from the earliest days of settlement. This course examines the emigration and settlement patterns of Irish immigrants in the various regions of Canada across a period of three centuries, paying particular attention to their role in the social, economic, political, cultural, and educational development of Canadian society. The course explores the various strategies by which Irish immigrants both adapted to and transformed the particular host society in which they found themselves, and looks at other immigrant communities as a means of understanding the special contribution of the Irish to Canada.

    <ex:cDescription>This course focuses on the design and analysis of market mechanisms, which are concerned with how to construct rules for allocating resources and how to structure successful marketplaces. It draws on tools of game theory to identify why certain market rules or institutions succeed and why others fail. Topics may include matching markets, auctions, contracts, economic platforms and network effects. The main objectives of this course are to introduce students to some of the fundamental concepts and ideas in the theory of market design and to connect this theory to real-life markets and to practical aspects of market design policy.

    <ex:cDescription>This course deals with some of the major questions about the neural bases of learning and memory. A number of mechanisms subserving learning and memory are investigated, including models based on relatively simple nervous systems (e.g.?conditioning in Aplysia), as well as more complex systems (e.g.?the neuronal mechanisms mediating eyeblink conditioning in the rabbit and the neuronal pathways that mediate reinforcement). Other topics may include the anatomical bases of memory, including the role of the hippocampus in spatial memory, and the role of the NMDA receptor in learning and memory.

    <ex:cDescription>This course uses language as a tool to examine the workings of the human mind. It approaches the study of language from the perspective of generative grammar as developed by Noam Chomsky and his collaborators. It deals with patterns of linguistic structure, rather than content or meaning. The goal of this course is to develop an understanding of the field of cognitive science (the study of knowledge and the mind/brain) and determine how linguistics fits in with disciplines like the study of vision, auditory perception and reasoning.

NOTE: Students who have received credit for this topic under a LING 398 number may not take this course for credit.

    <ex:cDescription>This course is an interdisciplinary introduction to the cultural and social processes of food creation and consumption. Students make connections between various aspects of the food world and their own roles and responsibilities within the food system. Through an exploration, not only of things eaten, but also of food spaces and food-related activities - including design, studio arts, and architecture - students discover that interactions with food are not as matter-of-fact as often assumed.

    <ex:cDescription>This lecture course introduces students to digital games, their history and their relationship to contemporary art practices. Digital games are considered as a medium of play, social interaction and artistic expression. The course situates digital games in an (art) historical context in order to better understand concepts of play in a digital age and the relevance of games to current art practices, beginning with examples of earlier games and their role as material culture. Students then reconsider the roles played by the art, the artist and the player/gamer as they are situated at the intersection between art, play and technology. Class discussions address life in virtual spaces and the relationships of power, capital, gender, ethnicity and other identities to both games and contemporary digital media.

    <ex:cDescription>From 17th-century fishermen and traders arriving in Newfoundland to displaced victims of the Famine in the 19th century, to contemporary immigrants from Ireland, the Irish have had a presence in all parts of Canada from the earliest days of settlement. This course examines the emigration and settlement patterns of Irish immigrants in the various regions of Canada across a period of three centuries, paying particular attention to their role in the social, economic, political, cultural, and educational development of Canadian society. The course explores the various strategies by which Irish immigrants both adapted to and transformed the particular host society in which they found themselves, and looks at other immigrant communities as a means of understanding the special contribution of the Irish to Canada.

    <ex:cDescription>Since many business enterprises are operated as corporations, it is important to familiarize students with the legal aspects involved in creating and managing a corporation. This course is aimed at both students who wish to set up new business enterprises and at those who wish to manage existing businesses effectively. Students study the legal process through which a corporation is set up, and examine strategically important issues relating to the control and voting of shares, unanimous shareholders agreements, the duties and liabilities of shareholders, directors, and officers, the sale of shares and the protections provided by law to minority shareholders. The Canada Business Corporations Act (C.B.C.A.) along with other related laws, actual court cases and sample legal documents are studied.

    <ex:cDescription>Zoroastrianism, an ancient but little-known faith now counting no more than a few hundred thousand practitioners living mainly in India and Iran, is one of the most significant traditions in the history of religions. It provided a world-view and ethical framework later adopted by Judaism, Christianity, and Islam and shares significant common roots with Hinduism. The Zoroastrians of India - the Parsis - have continued to play an influential role in shaping that countrys development in modern times. This course covers the 3,000-year history of Zoroastrianism, including controversies surrounding its origins, its contributions to other religions, its eventual decline and the surviving global Zoroastrian diaspora of contemporary times.</ex:cDescription>

    <ex:cDescription>About one-third of the world?s Muslims live in India, Pakistan, or Bangladesh, making Southern Asia the world region with the largest proportion of Muslims. Yet many aspects of Muslim belief and practice in these countries have a distinctively South Asian flavour and in some cases derive from regional cultural traditions. This course looks at the history of Muslim presence in Southern Asia, including its extensive political and cultural impact from the seventh century to the present, and investigates the complexities of communal identity over the course of that history. The role of Sufism and Muslim contributions to South Asian literature, art, architecture, and music are also explored.</ex:cDescription>

    <ex:cDescription>This is an interdisciplinary course offered to students who are either in Biology or Electrical and Computer Engineering programs. Students are introduced to the emerging field of synthetic biology and learn to design computational machines that can be implemented in biological media. The term is divided into two phases. In Phase I, Biology students learn basic computer hardware and software concepts, while Engineering students are introduced to gene structure and recombinant DNA technology. In Phase II, all students learn the principles and various applications of cell-based computational machines. Students work in teams to create a project proposal to describe the design of a computational machine using gene regulatory networks. A project is required.

    <ex:cDescription>This seminar explores the complex and politically-charged relationship between history and memory in modern Ireland in the contexts of politics, popular culture, commemoration practices, and scholarship. Drawing on the insights offered by the interdisciplinary field of memory studies, it explores the interactions between past and present and memory and forgetting by tracing the ways key historical events have been historicized, revised, commemorated, and otherwise remembered (and silenced) over time by nationalists, unionists, ?exiles?, and other ?communities of memory? in Ireland and among the Irish Diaspora. Possible memory case studies include the 1641 Rebellion; the Williamite War; the 1798 Rising; the Great Famine; the First World War and the events of the Irish Revolution; the Northern Irish ?Troubles?; and Church-State institutional abuse in independent Ireland.

    <ex:cDescription>This course investigates the changing literary and social roles of German women from the 18th to the 21st century. Selected readings of women?s literary and cultural productions will also illustrate the history of gender coding from the period of Empfindsamkeit to the fin de si?cle. In addition to examining cultural artifacts, such as novels, plays, screen scripts, paintings and advertisements, the course also offers an insight into the Women?s movement (both in Eastern and Western Germany). An introduction to main concepts of gender theory provides the basis to analyze the variety of gender identities and representations. The language of instruction is English, and no prior knowledge of the German language is required. Advanced-level students ? i.e., students placed at the 300 level or higher in German language courses ? must do the readings and submit their work in German.</ex:cDescription>

    <ex:cDescription>This course examines how an ?Atlantic world? emerged between the 15th and 19th centuries. As societies in Africa, the Americas, and Europe came into increasingly regular contact, the ocean became a nexus rather than a gulf between them. By studying historical documents from the period and scholarly debates about how to interpret them, we explore why and how these long-distance connections provoked a range of unprecedented transformations for people on four continents.

    <ex:cDescription>Psychology and the law interact in myriad ways. The criminal justice system, from its code to its enforcement, is based on implicit psychological assumptions about human behaviour and how it should be controlled. Those in the justice system make decisions based on evidence from observations and testimony, both of which are assumed to be gathered in an objective, unbiased manner. Those in psychological professions assume they can influence decisions made in the legal system by providing experimental evidence. This course examines the roles psychologists play in the legal system, the assumptions of both legal and psychological professional groups, and how these groups can complement one another.

    <ex:cDescription>This course covers fundamental quantitative and qualitative tools of risk management used to mitigate against supply chain risks in the context of supply and demand management strategies. Globalization initiatives in trade and money markets and increased worldwide security concerns have exposed supply chains to ever-increasing risks. Consequently, risk management along the supply chain has become an important function in order to decrease the level of vulnerability for the stakeholders. Topics include review of supply chain fundamentals and principles, risk identification and management, trade-offs in risk management, supply chain strategies for robustness, and scenario planning. Various case studies are used to highlight design and implementation issues.

    <ex:cDescription>Mathematics is used to unravel the secrets of nature. This course introduces students to the world of mathematical ideas and mathematical thinking. Without being overly technical, that is, without requiring any formal background from the student other than high school mathematics, the course delves into some of the great ideas of mathematics. The topics discussed range from the geometric results of the Ancient Greeks to the notion of infinity to more modern developments.

NOTE: This course is designed as a suitable elective for students following an undergraduate program. It has no formal prerequisites and will not qualify students to enrol for any other Mathematics course, and cannot be used to satisfy a Mathematics requirement in any BSc or BA program.
NOTE: Students who have received credit for INTE 215 or MATZ 215 may not take this course for credit.

Through reading and discussion of theoretical authors such as F. Schleiermacher, J. Ortega y Gasset, L. Venuti, H. K. Bhabha, and W. Mignolo, students analyze representative texts of Latin American culture which practically and aesthetically incorporate different problems and/or strategies of translation in the transcultural context of a globalization process of more than five centuries.</ex:cDescription>

    <ex:cDescription>The subject of this course is environmental quality. It proceeds through an analysis of the relationships among the natural environment, economics, and institutions. The objective is to depict the problem of environmental quality as an economic problem whose solution demands major changes in economic, political, and legal institutions. Attention is also given to policies of collective environmental actions in which the effective management of common property resources is discussed. The course concludes with a discussion of some broader issues, such as the consistency of improved environmental quality with continued economic and population growth.

    <ex:cDescription>Religious, historical, literary, and political contexts have been applied to come to terms with the events of the Holocaust. All of these are relevant as students read important and provocative novels dealing with such issues as ethics, the relationship between art and history, the use of humour and popular cultural forms, as well as the way that storytelling helps direct our understanding of events that are often said to be incomprehensible. The wider impact of fiction dealing with the Holocaust on the popular media, including film, CD-ROMs, video, and news reporting, is also considered.

    <ex:cDescription>This course offers a panorama of Ireland?s vibrant contemporary theatre landscape. It puts the exciting experimental developments of recent years under the spotlight, engaging with Irish drama that blurs the line between reality and fiction, that immerses its audiences in morally challenging worlds, and that pushes the boundaries of theatre as a medium. From the collectively devised works of Charabanc to Verbatim plays about the Northern Irish troubles, from activist theatre to street theatre, this course explores what happens when theatremakers step outside of conventional spaces and working methods to make art for our mediatized, technologized and globalized era.

    <ex:cDescription>This course deals with a blend of fascinating mathematical themes in various contexts: historical, cultural, and practical. It is intended for non-mathematics students. One of the aims of the course is to demonstrate the presence of mathematics and mathematical ideas in many aspects of modern life. At a deeper level, it is also intended to explain what mathematics is all about and why some easily stated assertions, such as Fermats last theorem, are so difficult to prove. Students who complete the course successfully should have enough understanding and knowledge of fundamental ideas and techniques of mathematics to appreciate its power, its beauty, and its relevance in so many different fields such as architecture, art, commerce, engineering, music, and all of the sciences.

    <ex:cDescription>This course explores the Jewish voice in Canadian literature which can be seen to be the first opening toward a multicultural tradition in this country. Writers such as A.M. Klein, Mordecai Richler, Henry Kreisel, and Leonard Cohen created an English-language tradition of Jewish writing that is varied, provocative, and lively. Students look at novels, short stories, some poetry, memoir, and criticism. Students also consider non-Jewish authors, such as Gwethalyn Graham and Mavis Gallant, who were among the first to write about Jewish characters for an English-speaking Canadian audience. This course allows students to consider issues related to Canadian identity and culture, ethnic studies, and multiculturalism alongside literary questions.
