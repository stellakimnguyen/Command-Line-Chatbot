The course is divided into two parts: 1) Molecular structure, which covers molecular mechanics and elementary electronic structure theory of atoms and molecules; and 2) Chemical reactivity, which covers applications of quantum chemistry and molecular dynamics techniques to studies of chemical reactions. The applications discussed include organic molecules and their reactions, peptides and proteins, drug design, DNA, polymers, inorganics, and materials. The course includes a practical component where students acquire hands-on experience with commonly used computational chemistry computer software. Lectures and laboratory.

	ex:cDescription "This course investigates the changing literary and social roles of German women from the 18th to the 21st century. Selected readings of women?s literary and cultural productions will also illustrate the history of gender coding from the period of Empfindsamkeit to the fin de si?cle. In addition to examining cultural artifacts, such as novels, plays, screen scripts, paintings and advertisements, the course also offers an insight into the Women?s movement (both in Eastern and Western Germany). An introduction to main concepts of gender theory provides the basis to analyze the variety of gender identities and representations. The language of instruction is English, and no prior knowledge of the German language is required. Advanced-level students ? i.e., students placed at the 300 level or higher in German language courses ? must do the readings and submit their work in German." .

This course assumes elementary knowledge of the Irish language as a platform for students to access cultural forms (memoirs, poetry, short stories, sean-n?s songs, films) and media such as radio, newspapers, television, and podcasts. In particular, the course examines how language is intimately tied to place and landscape (dinnsheanchas: the Irish lore of place names) and how it both actively and subliminally remains a potent force in Irish cultural life.

Possible memory case studies include the 1641 Rebellion; the Williamite War; the 1798 Rising; the Great Famine; the First World War and the events of the Irish Revolution; the Northern Irish ?Troubles?; and Church-State institutional abuse in independent Ireland.

At a deeper level, it is also intended to explain what mathematics is all about and why some easily stated assertions, such as Fermats last theorem, are so difficult to prove. Students who complete the course successfully should have enough understanding and knowledge of fundamental ideas and techniques of mathematics to appreciate its power, its beauty, and its relevance in so many different fields such as architecture, art, commerce, engineering, music, and all of the sciences.

Without being overly technical, that is, without requiring any formal background from the student other than high school mathematics, the course delves into some of the great ideas of mathematics. The topics discussed range from the geometric results of the Ancient Greeks to the notion of infinity to more modern developments.  NOTE: This course is designed as a suitable elective for students following an undergraduate program. It has no formal prerequisites and will not qualify students to enrol for any other Mathematics course, and cannot be used to satisfy a Mathematics requirement in any BSc or BA program. NOTE: Students who have received credit for INTE 215 or MATZ 215 may not take this course for credit.   " .
